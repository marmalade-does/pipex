# pipex
pipex project for 42

Things to ask people as 42 before handing in: 
* ask people in 42 if they used a tester for pipex becuase the one that I have been trying is just poopoo
* the buffer size in the pipex_rd_nxt_lne()
-- I put as 9999, however IDK if that is good, i put as INT_MAX earlier, however chat said it would fail. 
* Makefile good ? (both the root/tpipex  Makefile and the includes/libft makefile) and how you did the touch Makeefile thing? ----->>> expecially, there is a wildcard in there right? '*' that isn't allowed?


Before hanading in 
* remove the comments in ur functions
* remove the -fsanatize flag in the makefile
* make sure that the whole thing recompiles if the Makefile file is touched


Later (after pipex):
* think about integrating the gnl function in your libft --> (just so that you can move the librairy w/ everything in the future)
